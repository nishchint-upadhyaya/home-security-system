- Open VS Code terminal into "/FINAL_Deployment/nano_ble33_sense_microphone_V2" folder
- Create a .env within this folder with "UBIDOTS_TOKEN" set to your token value
- Connect Arduino through USB
- Create vnenv: python3 -m venv "home-security-ubidots"
- Activate venv: source home-security-ubidots/bin/activate
- Install required libraries within venv:
    - python3 -m pip install pyserial paho-mqtt python-dotenv
- Run "python3 MqttUbidots.py" through the Terminal
- Say the keyword for the Arduino to detect
- Once the keyword has been detected, the terminal will notify that a payload is being sent to Ubidots
- On Ubidots, a new device called "home-security" will be created with the payload
